    "\n",
    "This project analyzes the potential risks of three sizes of aircraft for private and commercial use by company new branch, PrimeAir. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Descriptive analysis of aviation accidents produced a Danger Zone Scale based on historic accidents related to plane models. \n",
    "* Descriptive analysis of the commercial aircraft inventory found the most commonly used commercial planes in three size categories. \n",
    "* The Danger Zone Scale was used to identify the aircraft models with the lowest historic reported risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "PrimeAir can use this analysis to select the lower risk planes for both commercial and private use from the most popular aircraft in recent commercial inventory. \n"

    "- Improve day-to-day operations by reducing potential interruptions. \n",

To eventually be able to work with the two datasets in tandem, we transformed the make values to all lowercase, and only kept the manufacturer names as part of the value.

    "\n",
    "* Exploring this data further  \n",
    "    * Further cleaning plane model types by removing planes no longer in production and compiling similar model types would sharpen results especially with regard to commercial small planes and private regional planes and small planes. \n",
    "    * Zeroing in on the desired size of plane will give more relevant results. For example, 120 seats or 300 makes a big difference in cost and purpose. \n",
    "    * Investigating the cause of accidents would allow for further recommendations specific to locals. For instance, an investigation of the weather would create good local plane recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bringing in other aircraft data \n",
    "    * Looking into incident level safety issues will fine tune safety score more specific analysis describing the cause of these accidents could provide better insight for our stakeholder. For example, if our stakeholder plans to only operate in one area of the country, then it would be valuable to identify typical weather conditions for that area and cross examine the airplanes that appear to perform poorly in those conditions.\n",
    "    * Investigating smaller air carrier/private plane inventory Will permit accurate risk ratings for small size aircraft \n",
    "    * Adding further analysis exploring lesser “incident” safety issues compiled by the FAA could further clarify risk level for each of these aircraft\n",
    "\n",
    "* Other factors \n",
    "    * Adding a cost analysis for the airplane options we are recommending would offer an additional level of business insight that would be valuable for our stakeholders. \n",
    "    * Conducting thorough industry research would provide a stakeholder expanding into a brand new business segment the opportunity to learn from similar peers’ mistakes and ensure that they do not make those same mistakes. \n",
